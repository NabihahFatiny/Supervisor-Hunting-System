# Supervisor Hunting System
A web-based platform designed to help students, lecturers, and coordinators manage Final Year Project (FYP) topics, applications, schedules, and appointments in one centralized system. The system improves organization, collaboration, and efficiency in the FYP allocation process. Lecturers can post FYP topics and manage applications, students can browse topics, apply for projects, and book appointments, while coordinators manage user registration, timeframes, quotas, and reports.

## Features 
- Coordinator-managed registration (register students and lecturers; bulk registration)  
- FYP topic management (add, edit, delete, and view FYP topics and titles)  
- Application management (students apply for titles, lecturers view and accept/reject applications)  
- Timeframe and quota management (coordinators set application periods and lecturer quotas)  
- Schedule management (lecturers upload schedules; students view timetables)  
- Appointment system (students request appointments; lecturers accept or reject requests)  
- User profile and change-password 
- Centralized dashboards for students, lecturers, and coordinators
